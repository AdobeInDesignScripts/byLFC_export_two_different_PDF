# byLFC_export_two_different_PDF
InDesign script to export current document to two different PDF files (different PDF Presets) with one single click.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
Unzip the JSX file to InDesign Scripts Panel folder (menu Window > Utilities > Scripts, then right click on "user" folder and choose to reveal in Explorer/Finder. Open the "Scripts Panel" folder). Saving the JSX file in this folder, it'll automatically be shown in Scripts panel inside InDesign software.

HOW TO RUN:
To run this script you must have a document open in InDesign.
With your document opened, go to Scripts panel (menu Window > Utilities > Scripts) and expand the "user" folder. To run the script, click twice on script filename. A dialog window will be shown asking you how PDF Presets do you want to use to export. Also, there is a field for page range. If this field is empty when you click OK, all document pages will be exported. Fill it using same InDesign defaults for page range (3,4-8,10) with commas and dashes.
